## about me

A current master's degree student, majoring in software engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University, graduated in 2016. About to join Alibaba as a front-end development engineer.

My main interest is in front-end development, and the concept of big front-end is deeply rooted in my heart. It's fun to put more business logic in the front end. At the same time, it feels very pleasant to realize what you have imagined.

I love beautiful things and rock music. I have formed a band and sold songs.

I really like Cui Jian's lyrics: Reality is like a stone, and spirit is like an egg. Although the stone is hard, there is life inside the egg.

Also, learning is a very enjoyable process. Letâ€™s work together!
